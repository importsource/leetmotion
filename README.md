# LeetCode Solutions

This repository serves as a personal collection of solutions to various LeetCode problems, primarily implemented using HTML and JavaScript. Each problem's solution is encapsulated within its own HTML file, making them easy to review and run directly in a web browser.

## Features

*   **Self-Contained Solutions**: Each LeetCode problem solution resides in its own `.html` file, including the problem description, input/output examples, and the JavaScript algorithm.
*   **Browser-Friendly**: Solutions can be opened directly in any modern web browser for quick testing and visualization.
*   **Easy Navigation**: An `index.html` file (if present) can serve as a central hub to browse through all available solutions.

## Solutions

Below is a list of the LeetCode problems currently solved and available in this repository:
